# Wordpress Headless Theme

A minimal theme to use Wordpress without its frontend.

## Why You Need This Theme

Useful if you want to use wordpress as a headless cms and build your own frontend, integrate it with custom app, or even your mobile app!

In my case, I need to integrate it with my Next.js app. So I deploy my wordpress at `wordpress.example.com` and consume the [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) at `example.com/blog`.

## How to use this theme

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open this repository with your text editor.
3. Edit `index.php`.
4. Change `https://example.com` to your blog or your WP Admin URL.
5. Zip this repository.
6. Upload and activate the theme.

If you don't care about the redirect URL, just download the theme [here](https://github.com/drizki/wordpress-headless-theme/releases/tag/1.0) and upload it to your Wordpress installation.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
